# This app reads in two input files; students.csv and teachers.parquet.

# To run the app (for now), place all python files in a single folder with the input above mentioned files. Then, open a cmd window and type in: python __main__.py

# Please note you have to have an installed python on your machine (version => 3.8.8). A newer update will provide an executable that does not require python installation.

# You can modify the input files names in the config.py file.

# Please forward any questions or feedbacks to: anasonline1@gmail.com
